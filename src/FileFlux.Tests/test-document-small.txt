FileFlux Document Processing Test

This is a small test document for FileFlux progressive processing.
It contains multiple paragraphs to demonstrate the chunking functionality.

Key Features:
- Progressive document processing with real-time progress tracking
- Multiple document format support (PDF, DOCX, TXT, etc.)
- Advanced chunking strategies for optimal RAG performance
- Clean architecture with dependency injection

Technical Implementation:
The system follows a clean architecture pattern with separate concerns for:
1. Document reading and text extraction
2. Content parsing and structure analysis  
3. Intelligent chunking for downstream processing
4. Progress reporting and error handling

This document is designed to be small enough to avoid context limits
while still providing meaningful content for testing the chunking algorithms.

Performance Considerations:
- Memory-efficient streaming for large files
- Configurable chunk sizes and overlap
- Support for different document types
- Extensible reader and parser architecture

The FileFlux SDK provides a zero-dependency solution for document processing
that integrates seamlessly with any RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation) pipeline.
